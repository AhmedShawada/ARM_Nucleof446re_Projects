# üöÄ ARM_Nucleof446RE_Projects

This repository contains a practical collection of embedded systems projects built using the **STM32 Nucleo-F446RE** board, focusing on low-level hardware control, I2C communication, PWM signal generation, ultrasonic sensing, and custom protocol handling. These projects were built using **STM32CubeMX**, **STM32CubeIDE**, and **HAL drivers**, and are intended for learning, experimentation, and building real-world embedded systems.
